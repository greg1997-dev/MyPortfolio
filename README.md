# [Markowitz Model for Optimal Portfolio](https://greg1997-dev.github.io/MyPortfolio/markowitz.html)
- Multiple weeks sitting at top 3 places on best portfolios on Reto Actinver 2022
- The methodology was:
  * Download the stock prices with the yfinance library
  * Clean the data and calculate:
    * Mean Returns
    * Log Returns
    * Portfolio Risk
    * Portfolio Returns
    * Sharpe Ratio
  * Create a function that created random weights for selecting a 10 stock portfolio randomly
  * Create 100,000 random portfolios 
  * Save the next best portfolio given the return

# [Probability and Statistics Course at Universidad Panamericana](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/Prob_and_Stats)
 - Leveraging the R programming language, students were able to have a deeper understanding of Probability and Statistics concepts such as:
 * Conditional Probability
 * Discrete Probability Distributions
 * Continuous Probability Distributions
 * Analysis of Variance
 * Experimental Design

# [Sankey Report for Laboratory](https://storage.googleapis.com/objects-hosted/Screenshot%202024-03-13%20at%2012.00.24%20PM.png)
 - Develop a whole data pipeline to provide ad hoc analytics on evaluating Lab Workers to correctly identify blood cells through a specific methodology.
 - Whole architecture is hosted on GCP with the final product is delivered through Looker Studio
 - Participants in this quality program are evaluated in two ways: the monthly expert, and an expert consensus to insure an unbiased assessment.

# [NFL Combine measurements importance](https://greg1997-dev.github.io/MyPortfolio/nflcombine.html)
- This project was to try to identify the most important variables for scouts to Draft a Prospect
- Compared Logistic Regression vs Random Forest Classifier and provide a better example
- Logit with Lasso Penalty was the best model
- 40 yd dash time, and Weight are the most important features
- AUC=0.72
- Model recommended to draft UDFA such as Jaylen Warren and Cameron Dicker
- Brock Purdy was a strong recommendation to draft

# [March Madness Kaggle Competition 2022](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/MyPortfolio/blob/main/notebooks/March_Madness.ipynb)

- This project was used in the [March Machine Learning Mania 2022 - Menâ€™s](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/overview) competition to predict the bracket
- Logistic Regression with CV was used for predicting the bracket
- Avg. Log Loss of the algorithm 0.68492
- Calculate probability of win for a team
- Beat the auto bracket (all teams have equal probability to win)
- Predicted St. Peter's Peacocks upset over No.2 Seed Kentucky and No. 3 Seed Purdue

# [NLP Project Assignment](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/MyPortfolio/blob/main/notebooks/Big_Data_Project.ipynb)

- Took Amazon Reviews Dataset (you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews))
- Looked at the most common reviews
- EDA 
- Created a topic classifier with an Latent Dichrilet Allocator (LDA)
- Classified possitive topics into 10 different categories based on their sentiment score

# [Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/Titanic_Kaggle_Competition/blob/main/notebooks/Titanic_Kaggle_Competition.ipynb)

- The most recommended Kaggle competition to get your hands on ML
- Voter Classifier that included distinct methodologies
- Feature engineering on deck in which passenger was assigned
- Filled NULL values in numeric dimensions with average of the column
- This project graded 0.77751 on accuracy

# [Insurance Project](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/MyPortfolio/blob/main/notebooks/Proyecto_Seguros.ipynb)

- Analyzed a Dataset and predict if a user would renew its insurance policy or not
- After an EDA we identified that users without a license we the most likely to not buy an insurance
- Users with older vehicles were more inclined to buy insurance policies
- Decision Tree was the best option for classifying users that were prone to buy an insurance policy
