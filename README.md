My Data Science Portfolio
## What you will find
This are some projects I've been working on throughout my career. As a sports fan, I've focused my projects on sports analytics. Also, I have included some projects I made during my Specialization in Data Science

# [NLP Project Assignment](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Big_Data_Project.ipynb)
- Took Amazon Reviews Dataset (you can find the dataset [here]())
- Looked at the most common reviews
- EDA 
- Created a topic classifier with an Latent Dichrilet Allocator (LDA)
- Classified possitive topics into 10 different categories based on their sentiment score

# [Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/Titanic_Kaggle_Competition/blob/main/Titanic_Kaggle_Competition.ipynb)
- The most recommended Kaggle competition to get your hands on ML
- Voter Classifier that included distinct methodologies
- Feature engineering on deck in which passenger was assigned
- Filled NULL values in numeric dimensions with average of the column
- This project graded 0.77751 on accuracy

# [NFL Combine measurements importance](https://github.com/greg1997-dev/MyPortfolio/blob/main/NFL_Combine.ipynb)
- This project was to try to identify the most important variables for scouts to Draft a Prospect
- Random Forest Classifier with high recall
- School from which the prospect comes, 40 yd dash time, and Weight are the most important features
- AUC=0.72

#[March Madness Kaggle Competition 2022]()
- This project was used in the [March Machine Learning Mania 2022 - Menâ€™s](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/overview) competition to predict the bracket
- Logistic Regression with CV was used for predicting the bracket
- Avg. Log Loss of the algorithm 0.68492
- Calculate probability of win for a team
- Beat the auto bracket (all teams have equal probability to win)
- Predicted St. Peter's Peacocks upset over No.2 Seed Kentucky and No. 3 Seed Purdue
